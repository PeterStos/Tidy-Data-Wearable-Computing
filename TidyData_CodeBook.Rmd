```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stats)
```
  
  
#### Loading files from TEST volunteers
  
Firstly the directory where **TEST** files were located was set as working directory. 
```{r Working directory test, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "C:/Users/peter/Documents/DataScience/Coursera/Cleaning Data/TidyData/getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/test")
```

The **X_test.txt** was read as table, adding the column names from the file **features.txt**. 
```{r}
test_col_names <- read.table("features.txt", header = FALSE)
col_names <- c(test_col_names[,2])
x_test_df <- read.table("X_test.txt", col.names = col_names, header = FALSE)
```
  
  
#### Subjects and Activities
  
The following code reads **subjects** (volunteers) from subject_test file
```{r}
subject_test <- read.table("subject_test.txt", col.names = "subject", header = FALSE)
```

Read column **activity** using y_test file:
```{r}
activity_test <- read.table("y_test.txt", col.names = "activity", header = FALSE)
activity_labels_test <- read.table("activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("activity", "labels"), header = FALSE)
```

Merge the columns activity and subject to the dataset **x_test_df**:
```{r}
x_test_df <- data.frame(x_test_df, subject_test)
x_test_df <- data.frame(x_test_df, activity_test)
```
  
  
#### Creating dataset for TRAINING volunteers
  
```{r Working directory trainig, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "C:/Users/peter/Documents/DataScience/Coursera/Cleaning Data/TidyData/getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/train")
```

The steps taken are the same as for TEST volunteers:
```{r}
train_col_names <- read.table("features.txt", header = FALSE)
col_names <- c(train_col_names[,2])
x_train_df <- read.table("X_train.txt", col.names = col_names, header = FALSE)

subject_train <- read.table("subject_train.txt", col.names = "subject", header = FALSE)

activity_train <- read.table("y_train.txt", col.names = "activity", header = FALSE)
activity_labels_train <- read.table("activity_labels.txt", col.names = c("activity", "labels"), header = FALSE)

x_train_df <- data.frame(x_train_df, subject_train)
x_train_df <- data.frame(x_train_df, activity_train)
```
  
  
#### Merging Test and Training datasets
  
The dataset *x_train_df* and *x_test_df* are merged to create one single dataset with all volunteers.  
This correspond to the step 1:  
**1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set**.
```{r}
train_test_df <- rbind(x_train_df, x_test_df)
train_test_df <- as_tibble(train_test_df)
```
  
  
#### Extraction of mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  
The criteria adopted to select the columns with mean and standard deviation was to select all column names that could contain the word *mean* or *std*, plus subject and activity.  
This step correspond to the step 2:  
**2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement**. 
```{r}
train_test_mean_std <- select(train_test_df, contains(c("subject", "activity", "mean", "std"), ignore.case = TRUE))
head(train_test_mean_std)
```
  
  
#### Rename activity numbers to names
  
This step correspond to the step 2:  
**3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set**  
```{r}
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "1"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[1] 
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "2"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[2]
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "3"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[3]
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "4"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[4]
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "5"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[5]
train_test_mean_std$activity[train_test_mean_std$activity == "6"] <- activity_labels_test$labels[6]
```

#### Avarage of each variable for activity and subject  
  
First the data set was grouped by subject and activity
```{r}
group_train_test <- group_by(train_test_mean_std, subject, activity)
```

Then a *result* dataset was created to calculate the mean by activity and subject
**5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**  
```{r}
result <- aggregate(group_train_test[,3:38], list(subject = train_test_mean_std$subject, activity = train_test_mean_std$activity), mean)
result <- as_tibble(result)
result_arranged <- (arrange(result, subject))
head(result_arranged,24)
```
